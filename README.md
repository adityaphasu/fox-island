# ü¶ä Fox Island

Welcome to Fox Island, a whimsical and fantastical digital world where curious foxes roam and playful adventures unfold.

## üìù Description

This is a React application which uses three.js to render a 3D sland with foxes. The user can interact with the island by dragging it causing it to rotate and clicking on the popups as they appear to visit the respective pages.
