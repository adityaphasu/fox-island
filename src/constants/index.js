    title: "Foxes are more like cats than dogs",
    description:
      "Similar to cats, foxes are nocturnal. Due to their vertically slanted pupils, they have increased visibility in dim light. Foxes also climb trees, use their whiskers to navigate, and even stalk their prey like cats. Grey foxes can retract their claws, too — just like cats. Grey foxes also more closely resemble cats, while red foxes have a similar appearance to dogs. Additionally, male foxes are called dogs while female foxes are called vixens. Foxes even tread like cats, using the balls of their feet to silently and elegantly stride.",

    title: "Foxes live in underground dens",
    description:
      "Fox families, also known as a skulk or leash of foxes, live in underground dens. When the vixen has her pups — a litter of foxes can range between one and 11 pups — they live in the den together for seven months while the pups grow. The pups live in the den with the vixen, while the dog fox gathers food. These underground dens also provide shelter from predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and bears.",

    description:
      "Yep, foxes stink. They have a sickly, musty scent that comes from the glands at the base of their tails. If you start smelling this around your home or in your crawl space, it may be an indicator that foxes are near.",

    title: "Foxes can make 40 different sounds",
    description:
      "What does the fox say? As it turns out, foxes can produce a variety of sounds — up to 40 to be exact. The most noticeable is their scream-like howl, which is sure to send a shiver up your spine. Gekkering, a series of guttural chattering, is also the most common noises made by foxes, especially in a dispute. Foxes, specifically red foxes, are highly territorial. In the event another fox intrudes into its territory, foxes are likely to chatter loudly back and forth in defense of their home.",
